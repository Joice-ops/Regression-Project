# Rent Price Prediction in Canada

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting rent prices across Canada by leveraging regression techniques to analyze various features of rental properties. The dataset includes information on the province, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and pet policies. The project explores different modeling approaches, including polynomial regression and interaction terms, to capture the complex relationships between features. After encountering issues with multicollinearity and model performance, RidgeCV regression was used as a final step to improve prediction accuracy and stability.
